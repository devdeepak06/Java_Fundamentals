//You have been given a random integer array/list(ARR) and a number X. Find and return the triplet(s) in the array/list which sum to X.
//Note:
//Given array/list can contain duplicate elements.
//The order of the triplet(s) is not important. So, in a pair where 5 is present in 6th and 7th position, both will be considered.
//Input format :
//The first line contains an Integer 't' which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run. Then the test cases follow.
//First line of each test case or query contains an integer 'N' representing the size of the first array/list.
//Second line contains 'N' single space separated integers representing the elements in the array/list.
//Third line contains an integer 'X'.
//Output format :
//For each test case, print the total number of triplets present in the array/list.
//Output for every test case will be printed in a separate line.
//Constraints :
//1 <= t <= 10^2
//0 <= N <= 10^3
//0 <= X <= 10^9
//Time Limit: 1 sec
//Sample Input 1:
//1
//7
//1 2 3 4 5 6 7
//12
//Sample Output 1:
//5
